```

After that, you will be asked how you would like to set up your project. We will choose the following options:

``` bash
? Do you want to use the default database (sqlite) ? Yes
? Start with an example structure & data? Yes <-- make sure you say yes 
? Start with Typescript? Yes
? Install dependencies with npm? Yes
? Initialize a git repository? Yes
```

Once everything is set up and all the dependencies are installed, you can start your Strapi server with the following command:

``` bash
cd server
npm run develop
```

You will be greeted with the **Admin Create Account** screen.

![003-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/003_strapi_5_0ec1eaaa6a.png)

Go ahead and create your first Strapi user.  All of this is local so you can use whatever you want.

Once you have created your user, you will be redirected to the **Strapi Dashboard** screen.

![004-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/004_strapi_5_87bc6d8f39.png)

### Publish Article Entries
Since we created our app with the example data, you should be able to navigate to your **Article** collection and see the data that was created for us.

![005-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/005_strapi_5_dc3a4a7540.png)

Now, let's make sure that all of the data is **published**.  If not, you can select all items via the checkbox and then click the **Publish** button.

![Strapi Articles Published](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/006_strapi_5_9c6055ac59.png)

### Enable API Access
Once all your articles are published, we will expose our Strapi API for the **Articles Collection**. This can be done in ***Settings -> Users & Permissions plugin -> Roles -> Public -> Article***.

You should have `find` and `findOne` selected.  If not, go ahead and select them.

![007-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/007_strapi_5_edd775db5f.png)

### Test API 
Now, if we make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:1337/api/articles`, we should see the following data for our articles.

![008-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/008_strapi_5_66883c2963.png)

> üñêÔ∏è Note: that article covers (images) are not returned. This is because the REST API by default does not populate any relations, media fields, components, or dynamic zones.. Learn more about [REST API: Population & Field Selection](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/populate-select).


So let's get the article covers by using the `populate=*` parameter: `http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*`

![vuejs strapi integration - api request.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/vuejs_strapi_integration_api_request_c748d16c83.png)

Nice, now that we have our Strapi 5 server setup, we can start to setup our Next.js application.


## Creat a Next.js App
It is recommended to use the `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. 

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
Depending on your project setup, you will answer the following prompts:

```bash
‚úî What is your project named? ‚Ä¶ nextjs-project
‚úî Would you like to use TypeScript? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Would you like to use ESLint? ‚Ä¶ No
‚úî Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ‚Ä¶ No
```

Ensure you select **"Yes"** for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Start Your Next.js Application
Start Next.js in development mode by running the command below.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Here is what your new Next.js application should look like on the URL http://localhost:3000:

![New Nextjs project.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/New_Nextjs_project_d6293795ef.png)

## Use an HTTP Client For Requests
Many HTTP clients are available, but on this integration page, we'll use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Using Axios
Install Axios by running any of the commands below:

```bash
# npm
npm i axios

# yarn
yarn add axios
```

### Using fetch
No installation needed

## Fetch Contents from Strapi
Execute a `GET` request on the **Article** collection type in order to fetch all your articles.

Be sure that you activated the `find` permission for the `Article` collection type.

> üñêÔ∏è NOTE: We want to also fetch **covers (images)** of articles, so we have to use the `populate` parameter as seen below.

### Using Axios
```javascript
import axios;

// fetch articles along with their covers
const response = await axios.get("http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*");
console.log(response.data.data);
```

### Using Fetch
```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*");
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data);
```

## Project Example
In this project example, you will fetch data from Strapi and display them in your Next.js application.

Head over to your Next.js entry file `./src/app/page.tsx` to proceed.

### Step 1: Specify the "use client" Directory
Inside the `./src/app/page.tsx` file, add the code below:

```javascript
// Path: ./src/app/page.tsx

"use client"; // This is a client-side component

```

The `"use client"` directive will tell Next.js to render a component on the [client-side](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-client) instead of the default [server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-server) directive.

### Step 2: Import React hooks and Image component
Import the React hooks `useEffect` and `useState` for side effects and state management respectively.

Also, import the `Image` component which provides automatic image optimization.


```javascript
"use client"; // This is a client-side component

// Import React hooks and Image component
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Image from "next/image";
```

### Step 3: Allow Images from Localhost in Next.js
Since you are working on a development environment localhost, you have to configure Next.js to allow images.

Navigate to `./next.config.ts` and add the following code:

```javascript
// Path: ./next.config.ts

import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */

  // Allow images from localhost
  images: {
    domains: ["localhost"],
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### Step 4: Create Data Type and Constant
Create an interface called `Article` which represents the data structure of the articles we will fetch from Strapi. Also, create a Strapi URL constant.

```javascript
export interface Article {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  cover: any;
  publishedAt: Date;
}

// Define Strapi URL
const STRAPI_URL = "http://localhost:1337";
```

### Step 5: Define `articles` State Variable
Create a state variable `articles` to hold articles data fetched from Strapi.

```javascript
// Define articles state
const [articles, setArticles] = useState<Article[]>([]);

```

### Step 6: Create Function to Fetch Articles
Create an asynchronous function that fetches the articles from the Strapi API. The data fetched is passed to `setArticles` to update the `articles` state.

```javascript
const getArticles = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${STRAPI_URL}/api/articles?populate=*`);
  const data = await response.json();
  setArticles(data.data);
};

```

### Step 7: Create a Function to Format Dates
Create a helper function to format the `publishedAt` date of the article into a human-readable format (MM/DD/YYYY).

```javascript
const formatDate = (date: Date) => {
  const options: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions = {
    year: "numeric",
    month: "2-digit",
    day: "2-digit",
  };
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", options);
};

```

### Step 8: Fetching Articles on Component Mount
Use the `useEffect` to run the `getArticles` function when the component mounts.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  getArticles();
}, []);

```

### Step 9: Render and Display Articles
```javascript
return (
  <div className="p-6">
    <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Next.js and Strapi Integration</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Articles</h2>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        {articles.map((article) => (
          <article
            key={article.id}
            className="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg overflow-hidden"
          >
            <Image
              className="w-full h-48 object-cover"
              src={STRAPI_URL + article.cover.url}
              alt={article.title}
              width={180}
              height={38}
              priority
            />
            <div className="p-4">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">{article.title}</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">{article.content}</p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                Published: {formatDate(article.publishedAt)}
              </p>
            </div>
          </article>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);

```

Now, this is what your Next.js project should look like:
